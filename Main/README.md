# LogoCreate

I want to be able to create a professional logo using code. I can answer a series of questions and in response a SVG logo is created. I add no more than 3 letters of my choice. I am able to change the shape to be circle, square, or triangle. I am asked the color of the text and shape. 

I must do the following on the command prompt 
npm install
node index.js

I will be prompted to ask questions about my logo. I can click on my logo.svg in browser to see what was created. Then I will do a:
npm run test

http://localhost:52330/Main/logo.svg
